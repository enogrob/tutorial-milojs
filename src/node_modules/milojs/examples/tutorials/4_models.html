            // Milo models allow us to safely access deeply nested properties
            // without risk of errors. The model is used as a function and takes
            // a string in the form of a property access path. When we do this,
            // we get a model path.
            var streetModelPath = user('.address.street');

            // Note: ModelPath instances can be used just like models. This can
            // be conveniente when dealing with complex data structures.

            // Unless you have specific use of the model path, you can just
            // access these methods directly like this.
            user('.address.street').set('Victoria Street');
            
            // You can get the whole data object of the model simply by calling
            // get on the model. This will console log a nested object.
            console.log('LOG 2: ', user.get() );
            
            // The string used in the model safe-access function can also take
            // array syntax.
            user('.friends[0]').set('Jason Green');
            user('.friends[1]').set('Evgeny Pobereskin');
            
            // We also have syntax for interpolation, simply pass a string with
            // a $1 and then a second value.
            console.log('LOG 3: ', user('.friends[$1]', 1).get());
            
            // This is the same as the following
            console.log('LOG 4: ', user('.friends[' + 1 + ']').get());
            
            // Interpolation can be used for property names, and we can pass 
            // multiple values
            console.log('LOG 5: ', user('.$1[$2]', 'friends', 0).get());
            
            // We can delete values
            user('.address.street').del();
            console.log('LOG 6: ', user.get());
            
            // Models are also equiped with array methods for dealing with
            // array data, you can use push, pop, splice, len, unshift, shift
            user('.friends').splice(1, 0, 'Chris Flook');
            console.log('LOG 7: ', user('.friends').get());
            
            // So it's great that models allow safe access to our data, but what
            // else can we do with them. The most powerful feature of models, is 
            // that for every change to the data, they are emitting messages. 
            // Every model and model path has a milo messenger attatched. The 
            // messenger methods are proxied to the model, so we can do this:
            user.on('.friends', function(msg, data) {
                // The handler will recieve the path, and a data object
                // containing the type of operation (splice, added, deleted etc) and
                // information about what changed, which will depend on what happened.
                console.log('LOG 8: ', msg, data);
            });
            
            // Let's add a new friend and see what gets logged.
            user('.friends').push('Superman');
            
            // In the example above, we are listening to changes of the '.friends' path
            // You can also pass regular expressions, like this to catch all /.*/
            user.on(/.*/, function(msg, data) { /*console.log(msg, data)*/ });
            
            // Constructing regex can be complex and hard to read, so milo provides
            // a syntax using * stars. The example below will get changes to all
            // array elements.
            user.on('.friends[*]', function(msg, data) { console.log('LOG 9: ', msg, data) });
            user('.friends[3]').set('The Queen of England');
            
            // The stars also represent depth, so to get all messages for three levels
            // of object depth, you could use three stars '***'
            
            // And ofcourse, as I said before, a model path can be used the same way.
            user('.friends').on('*', function(msg, data) { /*console.log(msg, data)*/ });
            
            // One final note: The whole point of these models is to safely access
            // nested data structures. So make sure you always use a path to get data.
            // You should never be doing this.
            var evgeny = user('.friends').get()[1]; // This could throw an error!
            
            // I only mention it because I did it a couple of time :o$
            // You should do it like this.
            evgeny = user('.friends[1]').get();
